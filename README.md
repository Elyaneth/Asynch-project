# Asynchronous Server Technologies Project

This project is essetially an express training.
Using its technology (and many others), we have created a project capable of managing users and metrics,
with login, logout, creation, deletion, etc...

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

First off, clone the repository from github.

Open a cmd, and type:
  cd ...  where ... is the path where you cloned the project.
  
Then, type:
  npm install
  this might take a while
  
You can then type:
  npm start       to start the app
  npm populate    to test the populating script (should write two lines in your cmd)
  npm test        to run the test script
  

To access the app, open your browser and type "http://localhost/8080"
